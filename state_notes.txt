State characteristics:
name: name of the state (will be used to produce a unique ID)
transition_table: all the causes/effects of stuff in this state

Transition table
================
Input_type	Input_detail	Result_type	Result_detail	Result_duration	Choice_share

There is likely also going to be a GLOBAL state transition table,
which will be logically combined with each state's local table,
possibly in a maskable fashion.

Input types:
STATE_INPUT_ENTER 	State is entered
					Input_detail is ignored 
STATE_INPUT_USER_IN The user selected an option from the input screen.
					Input_detail: the text of the option
STATE_INPUT_BUTTON 	AVOID USING IN FAVOR OF STATE_INPUT_USER_IN!
					A button was pressed (this will likely get more complicated)
					Input_detail contains button ID
STATE_INPUT_NET		Something happened over the network
					Input_detail is the ID of the radio event
					(we'll decide what these are soon. Meantime, just
					 put a consistent description in the detail field)
STATE_INPUT_TIMER	A fixed delay after the 
STATE_INPUT_TIMER_R	A recurring timer
STATE_INPUT_CONTD	This entry continues a LIST of results of the above trigger

If there are multiple identical (Input_type,Input_detail) pairs, then ties
will be broken probabilistically using Choice_share as its proportional
likelihood of being selected.

Result types:
RESULT_TEXT:
	Display a text message, possibly in a series, disappearing after the delay.
	Result_detail contains the message text. 
RESULT_SET_ANIM_TEMP:
	Display an animation on the LEDs, returning to the ambient once finished.
	Result_detail contains the name of the animation (which will map to IDs)
RESULT_SET_ANIM_BG:
	Set a new ambient animation, which will change once the 
	Result_detail contains the name of the animation (which will map to IDs)
RESULT_STATE_TRANSITION
	Transition to a new state
RESULT_OTHER
	Something else. Use this as a placeholder, and use the detail field to
	describe the details, but we'll ultimately create result events for all of 
	the possible effects, eventually.
	
NOP
    No operation
POP
    Return to previous state
CLOSE_STATE
    Blocks off the current state
    
Delay_duration:
	the length in seconds after a result occurs before the
	next result in the list is allowed to fire.
	Special options:
		DELAY_DEFAULT: 	The default delay length (may be different for different result types)
		DELAY_NONE:		Continue instantly (no delay)
